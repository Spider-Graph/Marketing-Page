            <h2>About GraTrack</h2>
            <p>At DynaTrack we aim at making everyday data pionts for training more dynamic with
                data viisualisions that lets you see a spread of many diffrent data pionts on many diffrent categories.
                The relative position and angle of the axes is typically uninformative. Although various heuristics, such as algorithms that plot data as the maximal total area, can be applied to sort the variables (axes)
                into relative positions that reveal distinct correlations, trade-offs, and a multitude of other comparative measures.
                We have been able to scale our clients performance at immense level to give them insight they need seamlessly.

            <h2>How it Work</h2>
            <p> On the example graph we plotted here, we used data pionts for an averge althlete in three diffrent events. Using our system is as easy as recording event times
                and plugging them into the system and running it to store an visiualize your performance. Our system allows you to plott data over time and comparatively analysing your 
                past and present perfomamce for optimal growth.

                Our entire system is built with acessbility in mind. We are aware that our audience are not just althletes that need to visualize their peformance, we also created a system 
                with the ability to plot any sort of veriable data. by making our features easy to use and seemless we hope we are able to serve a wide range for customers to render their 
                data more dynamic.

           <h2>Why Us</h2>
           <p>GraTrack gives our users a quick and easy fix to plotting their porformance like a pro. While there are many 
               companies that offer such a system, here at Gratrack we seprate our selfes by making it seemsless and easy to use. The other servicers that allow users to craft and visualize their 
               data in this way involve very complicated systems that only highly sophisticated experts with graphing experience can formulate. At GraTrack we make functionality easy to use and 
               avaible for anyone navice or pro.
